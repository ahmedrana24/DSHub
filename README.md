**DSHub** is a developer-focused platform designed to help users practice, implement, and collaborate on **data structures and algorithms** in a structured, real-world–inspired environment. Built around GitHub-like workflows, the project simulates core features such as **repository management, version control, code reviews, issue tracking, and collaboration**, all tailored specifically for learning data structures.

The platform promotes **hands-on learning and peer collaboration**, allowing developers to create, organize, and share their implementations while efficiently tracking changes. Through discussions, reviews, and clear documentation, users gain deeper insights into **algorithmic thinking, clean coding practices, and collaborative development**. DSHub prepares developers for real open-source contributions by bridging the gap between theory and professional software workflows.
